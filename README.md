# Reagreement of the Terms of Service with differences
#### xenforoaddon_termsReagreeAndDiff

### Abandon Date

2016-05-26

### Scenario

In a community where the admins made a lot of changes to the terms, it was needed that all members were put to agree with the new terms, but members just wanted reading an "executive summary" with what changed.

### Solution

An add-on that keeps track of all revisions of the terms and highlights what changed using boxes colored in gray, red and green to represent what wasn't changed, what was removed and what was added, repectively.
